This is an experimental library used for creating and reading in .BMP files. It
was made only for my own learning about image files.

"imgstats.cpp" is a usefull program that calculates statistics of .BMP files and
displays them in a consol window.

*** Both of this projects rely on "matrix.h" and "matrixmath.h"
Simply create a symbolic link to these into the directory of any project that
needs them.

Feel free to use this code!  Please just reference me in the code that uses this
as "Bryan A. Clifford".  Email me with any questions/comments/constructive
feedback at "blackscout111@gmail.com".
